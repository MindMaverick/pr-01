Practice Problems 
Try the following using for/while/ do...while loop 
1. Sum of Natural Numbers: 
Create a program that calculates the sum of natural numbers up to a given limit. Ask  the user to input the limit (a positive integer), then use a for loop to calculate and  display the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to the given limit. 
2. Print Multiplication Table: 
Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number. Ask the user to  input a number, then use a for loop to print its multiplication table from 1 to 10. 
3. Printing odd numbers within a Specific Range  
Imagine you're participating in a math club activity where you're tasked with  identifying and printing all the odd numbers within a specific range. Your task is to  create a program that takes a starting and ending point from the user and prints all the  odd numbers within that range. Remember, odd numbers are those that cannot be  divided evenly by 2, leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Use a for loop to  iterate through the numbers within the given range and print only the odd ones. 
4. Sum of Even Numbers within a Specific Range  
Picture yourself attending a mathematics workshop where you're presented with a  challenge: calculate the sum of all even numbers within a range specified by you.  Your task is to create a program that prompts you to enter a starting and ending point,  then calculates and displays the sum of all even numbers within that range. Even  numbers are those divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. Use a for loop to iterate  through the numbers within the given range and add up only the even ones.
